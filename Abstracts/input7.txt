Breast cancer has become one of the most deadly cancer
among women all over the word. Fortunately, an early diagnosis
of this type of cancer can considerably enhances the success of
treatment. In this work, we propose a classification system of the
breast cancer based on neural networks. The proposed system is a
neural network with single hidden layer and trained using extreme
learning machine algorithm. The main contribution of this work
relies on the use of different activation functions for the hidden
neurons and their optimization using genetic algorithm. To
evaluate the performance of the proposed system, tests are carried
out on Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer database. The
obtained results show an important enhancement compared to the
conventional extreme learning machine. On the other hand, the
obtained results are promising compared to other state-of-the-art
methods.
