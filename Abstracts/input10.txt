Breast cancer is one of the most common and
leading causes of cancer among women. Currently, it has
become the common health issue, and its incidence has
increased recently. Prior identification is the best way to
manage breast cancer results. Computer-aided detection or
diagnosis (CAD) systems plays a major role in prior
identification of breast cancer and can be used for reduction
of death rate among women. The main intent ion of this
paper is to make use of the recent advances in the
development of CAD systems and related techniques. The
mainstay of the project is to predict whether the person is
having breast cancer or not. Machine learning is nothing
but training the machines to learn and perform by itself
without any explicit program or instruction. So here,
predicting whether a person is suffering with breast cancer
or not is done with the help of the trained data.
