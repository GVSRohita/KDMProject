Accurate diagnosis of breast cancer in histopathology images is challenging due to the
heterogeneity of cancer cell growth as well as a variety of benign breast tissue proliferative lesions. In this
paper, we propose a practical and self-interpretable invasive cancer diagnosis solution. With minimum
annotation information, the proposed method mines contrast patterns between normal and malignant images
in a weak-supervised manner and generate a probability map of abnormalities to verify its reasoning.
Particularly, a fully convolutional autoencoder is used to learn the dominant structural patterns among normal
image patches. Patches that do not share the characteristics of this normal population are detected and
analyzed by one-class support vector machine and one-layer neural network.We apply the proposed method
to a public breast cancer image set. Our results, in consultation with a senior pathologist, demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms existing methods. The obtained probability map could benet the pathology
practice by providing visualized verication data and potentially leads to a better understanding of datadriven
diagnosis solutions.
