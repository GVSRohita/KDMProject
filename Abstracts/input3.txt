During their life, among 8% of women are
diagnosed with Breast cancer (BC), after lung cancer, BC is
the second popular cause of death in both developed and
undeveloped worlds. BC is characterized by the mutation of
genes, constant pain, changes in the size, color(redness), skin
texture of breasts. Classification of breast cancer leads
pathologists to find a systematic and objective prognostic,
generally the most frequent classification is binary (benign
cancer/malign cancer). Today, Machine Learning (ML)
techniques are being broadly used in the breast cancer
classification problem. They provide high classification
accuracy and effective diagnostic capabilities. In this paper,
we present two different classifiers: Naive Bayes (NB)
classifier and knearest neighbor (KNN) for breast cancer
classification. We propose a comparison between the two new
implementations and evaluate their accuracy using cross
validation. Results show that KNN gives the highest accuracy
(97.51%) with lowest error rate then NB classifier (96.19 %).
