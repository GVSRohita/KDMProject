Histopathological image analysis is an important technique for early diagnosis and detection
of breast cancer in clinical practice. However, it has limited efciency and thus the detection of breast
cancer is still an open issue in medical image analysis. To improve the early diagnostic accuracy of breast
cancer and reduce the workload of doctors, we devise a classication framework based on histology images
by combining deep learning with machine learning methodologies in this paper. Specically, we devise a
multi-network feature extraction model by using pre-trained deep convolution neural networks (DCNNs),
develop an effective feature dimension reduction method and train an ensemble support vector machine
(E-SVM). First, we preprocess the histological images via scale transformation and color enhancement
methods. Second, the multi-network features are extracted by using four pre-trained DCNNs (e.g., DenseNet-
121, ResNet-50, multi-level InceptionV3, and multi-level VGG-16). Third, a feature selection method via
dual-network orthogonal low-rank learning (DOLL) is further developed for performance boosting and
overtting alleviation. Finally, an E-SVM is trained via fused features and voting strategy to perform the
classication task, which classies the images into four classes (i.e., benign, in situ carcinomas, invasive
carcinomas, and normal). We evaluate the proposed method on the public ICIAR 2018 Challenge dataset of
histology images of breast cancer and achieve a high classication accuracy of 97.70%. Experimental results
show that our method can achieve quite promising performance and outperform state-of-the-art methods.
