The increasing availability of electronic health records (EHRs) creates opportunities for automated extraction of
information from clinical text. We hypothesized that natural language processing (NLP) could substantially reduce
the burden of manual abstraction in studies examining outcomes, like cancer recurrence, that are documented in

unstructured clinical text, such as progress notes, radiology reports, and pathology reports. We developed an NLP-
based system using open-source software to process electronic clinical notes from 1995 to 2012 for women with

early-stage incident breast cancers to identify whether and when recurrences were diagnosed. We developed and
evaluated the system using clinical notes from 1,472 patients receiving EHR-documented care in an integrated

health care system in the Pacific Northwest. A separate study provided the patient-level reference standard for re-
currence status and date. The NLP-based system correctly identified 92% of recurrences and estimated diagnosis

dates within 30 days for 88% of these. Specificity was 96%. The NLP-based system overlooked 5 of 65 recurrences,

4 because electronic documents were unavailable. The NLP-based system identified 5 other recurrences incor-
rectly classified as nonrecurrent in the reference standard. If used in similar cohorts, NLP could reduce by 90%

the number of EHR charts abstracted to identify confirmed breast cancer recurrence cases at a rate comparable
to traditional abstraction.
