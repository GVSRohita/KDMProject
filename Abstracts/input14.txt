Cancer is the common problem for all people in
the world with all types. Particularly, Breast Cancer is the most
frequent disease as a cancer type for women. Therefore, any
development for diagnosis and prediction of cancer disease is
capital important for a healthy life. Machine learning techniques
can make a huge contribute on the process of early diagnosis and
prediction of cancer. In this paper, two of the most popular
machine learning techniques have been used for classification of
Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Original) dataset and the classification
performance of these techniques have been compared with each
other using the values of accuracy, precision, recall and ROC
Area. The best performance has been obtained by Support
Vector Machine technique with the highest accuracy.
