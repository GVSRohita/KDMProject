Identification of breast cancer plays a major role in
medical field nowadays. Women are facing different types
of cancer and one among them is breast cancer which has
severe impact. Breast cancer is of two types i.e. Malign or
Benign type. Benign is given as a non-curable type of
cancer and Malign is given as curable type of cancer.
Breast cancer is symbolized by the modification of genes,
persistent pain, changes in the measurement, change in
shade(redness),skin appearance of breasts. In the early
days of identifying breast cancer is done by using different
algorithms namely Support Vector Machine (SVM)
algorithm ,K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm , MLP
algorithm, etc., By using these algorithms the accuracy of
detecting the cancer is not met the extend. Our idea is to
detect the breast cancer using Decision Tree algorithm.
The decision tree algorithm comes under the supervised
learning technique. Our idea is to detect the breast cancer
using Decision Tree algorithm. The tree algorithm comes
under the supervised learning technique. The main
advantage of this decision tree algorithm is identifying
whether the predicted cancer is either malign or benign
type by producing an 99% accuracy.
