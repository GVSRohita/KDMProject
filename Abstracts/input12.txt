The diagnosis of breast cancer histology images with hematoxylin and eosin stained is
non-trivial, labor-intensive and often leads to a disagreement between pathologists. Computer-assisted diagnosis
systems contribute to help pathologists improve diagnostic consistency and efciency.With the recent
advances in deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully used for histology
images analysis. The classication of breast cancer histology images into normal, benign, and malignant
sub-classes is related to cells' density, variability, and organization along with overall tissue structure and
morphology. Based on this, we extract both smaller and larger size patches from histology images, including
cell-level and tissue-level features, respectively. However, there are some sampled cell-level patches that
do not contain enough information that matches the image tag. Therefore, we propose a patches' screening
method based on the clustering algorithm and CNN to select more discriminative patches. The approach
proposed in this paper is applied to the 4-class classication of breast cancer histology images and achieves
95% accuracy on the initial test set and 88.89% accuracy on the overall test set. The results are competitive
compared to the results of other state-of-the-art methods.
