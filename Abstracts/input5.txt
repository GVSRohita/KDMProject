Breast cancer is very popular between females
all over the world. However, detecting this cancer in its first
stages helps in saving lives. Radiologists have the ability to
predict if the mammography images have cancer or not, but
they may miss about 15% of them. In this paper, we proposed
a new method to detect the breast cancer with high accuracy.
This method consists of two main parts, in the first part the
image processing techniques are used to prepare the
mammography images for feature and pattern extraction
process. The extracted features are utilized as an input for a
two types of supervised learning models, which are Back
Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) model and the Logistic
Regression (LR) model with comparing the result and the
accuracy for the both models.
