Underlying a cancer phenotype is a specific gene regulatory network that represents the complex regulatory relationships
between genes. It remains, however, a challenge to find cancer-related gene regulatory network because of insufficient sample sizes
and complex regulatory mechanisms in which gene is influenced by not only other genes but also other biological factors. With the
development of high-throughput technologies and the unprecedented wealth of multi-omics data it gives us a new opportunity to design
machine learning method to investigate underlying gene regulatory network. In this paper, we propose an approach, which use Biweight
Midcorrelation to measure the correlation between factors and make use of Nonconvex Penalty based sparse regression for Gene
Regulatory Network inference (BMNPGRN). BMNCGRN incorporates multi-omics data (including DNA methylation and copy number
variation) and their interactions in gene regulatory network model. The experimental results on synthetic datasets show that BMNPGRN
outperforms popular and state-of-the-art methods (including DCGRN, ARACNE, and CLR) under false positive control. Furthermore, we
appliedBMNPGRN on breast cancer (BRCA) data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and provided gene regulatory network.
