As a trending medical imaging technique,
Elastography and B-mode (ultrasound) are combined as a
diagnostic tool to differentiate between benign and malignant
breast lesions based on their stiffness and geometric properties.
Image processing techniques are applied to the resulting images
for feature extraction. Data preprocessing methods and principal
component analysis (PCA) as a dimensionality reduction
technique are applied to the dataset. In this paper, supervised
learning algorithm “support vector machine (SVM)” is used for
the classification of combined elastogram and B-mode images.
Model validation is performed with K-fold cross-validation to
ensure the generalization of the algorithm. Accuracy, confusion
matrix, and logistic loss are then evaluated for the used
algorithm. The maximum classification accuracy is 94.12% when
using SVM with radial basis function (RBF) kernel.
