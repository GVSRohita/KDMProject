According to Breast Cancer Institute (BCI), Breast Cancer is one of the most dangerous type of diseases that is very effective for women in the world. As per clinical expert detecting this cancer in its first stage helps in saving lives. As per cancer.net offers individualized guides for more than 120 types of cancer and related hereditary syndromes. For detecting breast cancer mostly machine learning techniques are used. In this paper we proposed adaptive ensemble voting method for diagnosed breast cancer using Wisconsin Breast Cancer database. The aim of this work is to compare and explain how ANN and logistic algorithm provide better solution when its work with ensemble machine learning algorithms for diagnosing breast cancer even the variables are reduced. In this paper we used the Wisconsin Diagnosis Breast Cancer dataset. When compared to related work from the literature. It is shown that the ANN approach with logistic algorithm is achieved 98.50% accuracy from another machine learning algorithm.
