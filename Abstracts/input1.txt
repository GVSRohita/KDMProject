Breast cancer is the leading type of cancer among
women in the 3rd world countries with < 50% survival rate.
However, its early diagnosis can lead to cost-effective and
successful treatment. Traditional breast cancer screening tools
like mammography and MRI are not readily available to the
population in low-income countries. Thermography (infrared
imaging) is an FDA approved adjunct screening tool which can be
an alternative solution. We present here the architecture of
thermography based, application-specific Digital Back End (DBE)
processor for a handheld off the shelf portable and intelligent
screening device. A thermal image of the thorax taken by an
infrared camera is pre-processed to get the regions of interest. To
achieve efficient hardware implementation texture features are
carefully selected, which are then fed to a dual classifier based on
trained Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) and
convolutional neural network (CNN) to decide the decision
boundary. The proposed system achieves an overall sensitivity and
specificity of 90.06% and 91.8%, respectively, with efficient
hardware implementation by exploiting proposed classifier.
