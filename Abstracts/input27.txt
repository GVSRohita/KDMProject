Purpose: Mammography,
the standard method of breast cancer
screening, misses many cancers,
especially in dense-breasted women.
We compared the performance and
diagnostic yield of mammography
alone versus an automated whole
breast ultrasound (AWBU) plus
mammography in women with dense
breasts and/or at elevated risk of
breast cancer. Methods: AWBU
screening was tested in 4,419 women
having routine mammography (Trial
Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov
Identifier: NCT00649337). Cancers
occurring during the study and
subsequent 1-year follow-up were
evaluated. Sensitivity, specificity and
positive predictive value (PPV) of

biopsy recommendation for mam-
mography alone, AWBU and

mammography with AWBU were
calculated. Results: Breast cancer
detection doubled from 23 to 46 in

6,425 studies using AWBU with

mammography, resulting in an in-
crease in diagnostic yield from 3.6

per 1,000 with mammography alone
to 7.2 per 1,000 by adding AWBU.

PPV for biopsy based on mammog-
raphy findings was 39.0% and for

AWBU 38.4%. The number of
detected invasive cancers 10 mm or
less in size tripled from 7 to 21 when
AWBU findings were added to
mammography. Conclusion:
AWBU resulted in significant cancer
detection improvement compared

with mammography alone. Addi-
tional detection and the smaller size

of invasive cancers may justify this
technologyâ€™s expense for women
with dense breasts and/or at high risk
for breast cancer.
