The automatic classification of pathological images
of breast cancer has important clinical value. In order to
improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer detection, we
implement two classifications in this paper. (1) Train deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) models based on AlexNet
and GoogLeNet network structures. (2) Take the idea of
transfer learning to complete the training of classification
models. We use CNN to extract image features, then select
distinguished features to simplify feature set, and combine
them with texture features of images. At last, a Support Vector
Machine (SVM) is used for feature learning and classification.
